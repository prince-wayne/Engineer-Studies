# 🧠 LeetCode Practice Repository

Welcome to my personal LeetCode repository! This is where I regularly upload my solutions, notes, and learning insights from solving algorithm and data structure problems on [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com).

[**My Leetcode Profile**](https://leetcode.com/u/Prince-the-kid/)

## 🗂️ Structure

The repository is organized by problem difficulty and topic (whenever applicable). Each problem folder contains:

- `Solution file`: My implementation (in preferred language — usually JavaScript, Python, or C++).
- `README.md`: A brief explanation of the problem, my thought process, and time/space complexity.
- `Notes/Comments`: Sometimes included directly in code or as a separate file for deeper analysis.

## 💡 Goals

- Sharpen problem-solving skills.
- Improve algorithmic thinking for interviews.
- Build a consistent habit of daily or weekly practice.
- Track personal growth over time.

## 🧪 Topics Covered

| Topic | Count | 
| -| -|
Dynamic Programming  | 1 
Divide and Conquer  | 1
Hash / Hash Table   | 1
Sliding Window      | 1
Array                | 1
Two pointers     | 3 
Sorting   | 2

_(...and more as I progress!)_

## 🛠️ Tools

- Language: `JavaScript` as my primary, as I learn others like `phyton` and `c++`
- IDE: VSCode
- Testing: Mostly leetcode suite, manual when able, my laptop is lacking storage space (same reason we're not developing projects)

## 📅 Update Schedule

I aim to update this repo on a regular basis, hopefully Fridays or Mondays — usually after each practice session. Follow along to track my growth!

## 📬 Feedback or Suggestions?

Feel free to open an issue or leave a comment if you’d like to suggest a better approach or if you spot an error. Constructive feedback is always welcome!
